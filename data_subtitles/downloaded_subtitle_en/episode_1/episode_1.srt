1
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,604
Cold wind isn't good for you.

2
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,070
Ji-won.

3
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,156
You're still so pretty.

4
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,539
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

5
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,833
Don't forget you have me.

6
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,126
You have to live a long life with me.

7
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:09,839
Thanks.

8
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,843
I got unlucky in my marriage,
but I'm glad I have you.

9
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,932
Why would you say that?

10
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,767
Min-hwan's a great husband.

11
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,980
-He's cheating on me.
-What?

12
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,024
He texted me
"I love you" and "I miss you."

13
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,069
Then he deleted it right away.

14
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,072
I'm sure it was sent by mistake.

15
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,326
Don't get sensitive.

16
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,754
Do you want me to talk to him?

17
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,050
Forget it. I just need you.

18
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,721
I only need you too.

19
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,851
Let's only think good thoughts.
Okay, my other half?

20
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:11,233
Ms. Kang Ji-won,
it's time to go to the transfusion room.

21
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,614
This medicine won't hurt at all.

22
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,657
You'll get better once it's done.

23
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,453
Never give up.

24
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,130
CHEMOTHERAPY

25
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,863
I can't remember the last time
I was happy.

26
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,282
So why do I miss it so much?

27
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,995
I was given six months.

28
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,706
Twelve months, if there was a miracle.

29
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,378
It's all pointless now.

30
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,435
Great job. You look so beautiful today.

31
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,358
You look beautiful.

32
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,112
I picked the perfect dress for you!

33
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,164
Forget it. You're part of our family now.

34
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,374
You're my daughter.

35
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,586
You poor thing.

36
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,340
It's not your fault that you didn't
receive proper household discipline.

37
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,927
As your mother, I'll teach you now.

38
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,431
You pitiful girl.

39
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,857
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

40
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,025
Three generations!

41
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,068
How dare you sever that?

42
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,319
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,241
I took in a worthless girl like you.
Why can't you have kids?

44
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,203
Do you even know how to do anything?

45
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,082
-Mom, bear with her.
-Let go.

46
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,047
What a waste. Sit down.
Why are you so angry?

47
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,007
DUGA HOLDINGS

48
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,010
What? You quit your job?

49
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,095
I'm going into stocks.

50
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,097
Do you remember Roijental? Look.

51
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:51,143
A few more trades,
and it could change our lives.

52
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,063
But I can't trade when I need to
because of work.

53
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,273
It won't work for me.

54
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,400
We have monthly loan payments!

55
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,152
We should've discussed this!

56
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,404
Hey! Are you messing with me?

57
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,699
Why would I have to discuss this with you?

58
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,660
Mom!

59
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,581
Do you think I'll do well?
Do you think I'll hit it big?

60
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,418
Of course. My son can do anything.

61
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,505
Issues at home?
Does the world revolve around you?

62
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,840
Everyone here has issues at home.

63
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,927
This is why married woman shouldn't work.

64
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,764
What are you doing?

65
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,766
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,087
You said you'd fix the lock today.

67
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,131
Do I look like a bum?

68
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,885
Working overtime every day

69
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,971
doesn't mean you're good at your job.

70
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,558
You're so busy running around
because you're so bad at it.

71
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,143
Know your place.

72
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,311
Don't you hear the washing machine?

73
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,604
I started it,

74
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,731
-so you could've taken out--
-Jeez.

75
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,649
Hey!

76
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,944
I've been working all day,
and I just sat down.

77
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,779
I won't do it.

78
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:36,165
It's stage 4 gastric cancer.

79
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,293
Things don't look good.

80
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,511
You poor thing.

81
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,430
My poor son.

82
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,975
Why did you have to marry her?

83
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,478
This is why you have to pick
people carefully.

84
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,275
I thought things were looking up.
How could I be so unlucky?

85
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,903
Mom, if Ji-won has cancer,

86
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,362
who will make my meals?

87
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,325
You're too nice!
Why would you worry about that?

88
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,203
People need to work to overcome illness.

89
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,206
Technology is advanced these days.
She'll be fine.

90
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,625
Right?

91
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,378
Don't think about telling your company.
Work until you can.

92
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,133
Don't think about acting emotionally
just because you're sick.

93
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,384
It's a nuisance!

94
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,304
Can't they just zap it out?

95
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,224
It'll be fine. We've got technology.

96
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,268
Cancer is no big deal nowadays.

97
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,484
Your therapy is finished.

98
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,407
EPISODE 1

99
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,374
Don't worry about your husband's affair.

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,252
It's better off without them
when you're older.

101
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,674
You're not well.
Don't think about bad things.

102
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,053
You have a great friend.

103
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,846
She's so pretty and pleasant.

104
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,521
You're right. I have a great friend.

105
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,292
She's a good worker too.

106
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,128
She's a manager at U&K.

107
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,298
It's the company I worked at.

108
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,824
To be honest, I lack a lot of things.

109
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,413
Babe!

110
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,470
But Su-min was the only one
who stayed by my side.

111
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,900
She's always been,

112
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,944
and she always will.

113
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,200
Ms. Kang Ji-won?

114
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,078
Well...

115
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:05,165
Your guardian must come
if you want to continue treatment.

116
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,835
They need to come pay or take you home.

117
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,718
I'm very sorry.

118
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,221
Please settle it by the end of the day.

119
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,807
The person you are trying to call...

120
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:28,814
Pick up.

121
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,070
The person you are trying...

122
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,655
Did you take the deposit?

123
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,031
Answer the phone.

124
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,325
I'm begging you. Pick up the phone.

125
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,705
You quit your job after we got married,

126
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,040
so I had to support us, but forget that.

127
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,168
But at least pay the hospital bills.

128
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,294
Answer the phone.

129
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,431
PYEONGAN MEDICAL CENTER

130
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,768
TAXI
VACANT

131
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,231
Heungma-dong, Haeyeong Villa.

132
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,784
Goodness. You must be really sick.

133
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,953
You'll get better.

134
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,081
Spring has come.

135
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,958
I won't get better.

136
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,503
I'm dying.

137
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,921
Stop it.

138
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,089
You can't say bad things like that.

139
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,925
The doctors told me.

140
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,010
It's true.

141
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,930
Nothing good can come from living.

142
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,890
Why would you say that?

143
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,436
TAXI DRIVER CERTIFICATION
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

144
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,189
My father passed away early.

145
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,399
I don't have siblings.

146
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,653
I barely have a husband.

147
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,197
No.

148
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,284
It would've been better not to have one.

149
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,747
Then...

150
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,752
I wouldn't have any debt,
and I'd be able to pay my hospital bills.

151
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:06,471
You need to follow your path
until the very end to know for sure.

152
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,604
Excuse me. This isn't the way.

153
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:18,316
I'll take you down a good path.
Just trust me.

154
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,256
See? We're here.

155
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,383
I told you.

156
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,677
The path you know isn't the only one.

157
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,930
There are other paths.

158
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,557
That path could be better.

159
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,025
HAEYEONG VILLA

160
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,154
9,600 WON

161
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:47,989
Thank you.

162
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,908
Wait just a moment.

163
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,379
Ma'am?

164
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,051
This is my last day as a taxi driver.

165
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,722
Take it. Think of it
as an allowance from your dad.

166
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,350
You'll gain energy in no time.

167
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,936
You'll be running around,
making big money.

168
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,979
You'll meet someone

169
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:23,566
who would die for you
and have a good life.

170
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,028
No, you don't have to do this.

171
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,123
Come on now!

172
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,875
You're hurting an old man's arm!

173
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,075
But I think you're really smart, babe.

174
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,370
How did you think of cancer insurance?

175
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,251
Her dad died of cancer.

176
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,421
She kept getting thinner.

177
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,216
I thought it was time,
so I took out a policy.

178
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,849
Amazing. You did a good job.

179
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,022
Was it a billion won?

180
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,107
Yeah, if she dies.

181
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,404
I already got the diagnostic insurance
and bought you that designer bag.

182
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,617
I put the rest in stocks
to buy you a better bag.

183
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,953
You're so sweet.

184
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,789
Let's buy a house when Ji-won dies.

185
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,374
That sounds nice.

186
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,460
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

187
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:51,256
I even didn't tell her to go
to a doctor after I took out the policy.

188
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,301
She's persistent.

189
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,475
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

190
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,230
No. What if you fall too?

191
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,566
Why not? I can push her gently.

192
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,818
No one would know.

193
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,363
What the hell has she been eating?
Why is she so tenacious?

194
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,490
You should eat whatever she ate.

195
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,910
I don't need to. I'm already strong.

196
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,050
You crazy bastards!

197
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,306
Ji-won?

198
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,099
Babe, are you okay?

199
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,475
Spit it out!

200
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,066
-Are you okay, babe?
-I'm okay.

201
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,987
This is insurance fraud.

202
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm going to report you.

203
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,617
Hey!

204
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,868
What the hell?

205
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,662
Babe, are you okay?

206
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,205
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

207
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,290
-Yeah.
-Okay.

208
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,168
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

209
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,629
Jeong Su-min.

210
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,437
I'm going to kill you both!

211
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,857
I'll kill you both!

212
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,359
Hey!

213
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,194
That's enough.

214
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,113
Aren't you sick of this?

215
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,282
Come on.

216
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,493
This little...

217
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,169
Hey.

218
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,882
What the hell can you do right now?

219
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,512
Let's go.

220
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,055
Move out of the way.

221
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,687
Hey!

222
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,781
Come on!

223
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,199
Wait.

224
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,497
Ji-won.

225
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:44,512
I'm sorry.

226
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,310
You're sorry?

227
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,146
That's enough.

228
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,029
We can't do anything about it now.

229
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,281
The living should go on living.

230
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,743
You're going to die anyway.

231
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,828
You always think only about yourself.

232
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,928
This is great.

233
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,479
You think you won't die?

234
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,440
You don't think it'll happen to you?

235
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,609
-It'll happen to you.
-Stop!

236
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,402
-What?
-Stop it!

237
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,488
Babe!

238
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,447
Hey!

239
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,992
If you're going to die,
just die already. Get lost!

240
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,814
I longed for the happiness I've never had,
yet here I am,

241
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,567
with my good old friend, unhappiness.

242
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,372
Babe.

243
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,749
I think she's dead.

244
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,002
She was going to die anyway.

245
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,754
Does it matter how she dies?

246
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,964
What happens to us?

247
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,090
Stop talking!

248
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,844
People with cancer faint often.

249
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,262
She tripped and fell.

250
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,889
And we found her like this.
We know nothing.

251
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,642
What if we don't get paid?

252
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,810
-Well?
-What now?

253
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,271
I was given six months.

254
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,606
Twelve months, if there was a miracle.

255
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,069
I didn't even get to live that much.

256
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,073
I just died.

257
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:12,285
APRIL 12, 2023

258
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,343
Babe, what are you doing?

259
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:34,932
Why are you spacing out?

260
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,520
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?

261
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,454
Did you go to the hospital?

262
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,207
What did they say?

263
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,679
Babe, what's wrong? That hurts!

264
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,139
That hurts!

265
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,858
What's wrong with you?

266
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,819
Hey!

267
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,365
Kang Ji-won, let go! Let go of me!

268
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,908
Let go of me right now!

269
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,326
Ji-won, let go!

270
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,786
God damn it! Let go!

271
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,707
Ms. Kang Ji-won!

272
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:49,924
Snap out of it.

273
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,009
We're at work. What are you doing?

274
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,554
Work?

275
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:14,365
Are you okay?

276
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:20,997
What's going on?

277
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,498
I don't know.

278
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,003
Were you hurt?

279
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,714
Just a second.

280
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,633
Kang Ji-won.

281
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,267
Ji-won!

282
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,269
The living should go on living.

283
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,979
You're going to die anyway.

284
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,815
Get lost!

285
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,415
Hey, Ji-won!

286
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,117
Stop.

287
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,128
Can you calm down now?

288
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,217

Where are we?

297
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,632
From the company,

298
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,383
you ran over 200 meters.

299
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,593
You were sprinting.

300
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,891
I should ask you the same.

301
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,437
What's going on?

302
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,764
Do you have something warm at home?

303
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,403
No, I'm fine.

304
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,529
Do you have cash?

305
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,073
You have no phone or wallet.

306
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,867
ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

307
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:15,791
Take it.

308
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,003
There are times you need
someone else's help.

309
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,760

It's all 2013.

313
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:48,926
It's warm.

314
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,325
Let's me get this straight.

315
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,578
Is this a dream?

316
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,748
If it is a dream, which one is real?

317
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,546
Dying at the hands
of Park Min-hwan in 2023?

318
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:30,759
Or 2013 when I'm 31?

319
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,888
No, 2023 wasn't a dream.

320
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,598
I...

321
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,602
I know who General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk is.

322
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,107
Mr. Yu Ji-hyuk, how do you feel?

323
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,569
Chairman Yu Ji-hyuk,
who was promoted to CEO of U&K in 2021,

324
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,447
has full ownership
of U&K Food and Finance...

325
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,032
His succession process has been completed.

U&K GROUP CEO INAUGURATION

2021 51ST ANNUAL U&K SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

328
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,335
No one knows right now,

329
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,670
but our general manager...

330
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,172
I will not stop

331
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,551
until we become
a global lifestyle company.

332
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,594
...is U&K founder Yu Han-il's grandson.

333
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,804
That's my vision of U&K.

334
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,725
His succession process will begin
in a few years.

335
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,568
The fact that I know this...

336
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,029
Does it mean I travelled back in time?

337
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,868
That's right.

338
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,914
Where's the money he gave me?

339
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,415
Here it is.

340
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,360
Take it. Think of it as an allowance
from your dad.

341
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,575
You can't mark on money.

342
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,127
Dad!

343
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,213
You can't draw on money like that.

344
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,340
Those aren't drawings.

345
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,050
It's love.

346
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,803
To us, it is love, but you can't do this.

347
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,347
Fine. Don't worry.

348
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,225
I should listen to you.

349
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,977
I'll do everything you want.

350
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,481
I can't believe you.

351
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,089
It's from Dad.

352
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,133
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

353
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,843

00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:27,102
I'll do it all.

355
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,812
I'll do everything for you!

356
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,404
Dad...

357
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,368
You should have told me it was you.

358
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,788
Why is your face so bloated?

359
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,543
Come out. Let's go eat.

360
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,137
Ji-won, what's going on?

361
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,890
You haven't been picking up
since you ran out.

362
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,767
I'm worried about you.

363
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,560
I'm coming over right now.

364
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,896
I'm not feeling well.

365
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,148
Don't come. I'm with Min-hwan.

366
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,656
Oh, my.

367
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,581
Hey.

368
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,335
You're so immature.

369
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,631
Yeah, I know you have a lot on your mind.
That's okay.

370
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,467
I don't understand,

371
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,636
but women say it happens, so, fine.

372
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,763
I get it.

373
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,974
But you're making it too obvious at work.

374
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,642
Isn't that wrong?

375
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:34,229
What good can come
from making things bad for me?

376
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,025
Speak so I can understand.

377
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,743
When did it happen?

378
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,121
We haven't done it in a while.

379
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,456
Why are you pregnant?

380
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,626
Are you sure it's mine?

381
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,130
What?

382
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,007
You told me you think you're pregnant.

383
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,135
I remember.

384
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,930
I couldn't stomach anything,
so I thought I was pregnant.

385
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,349
It was gastritis from stress.

386
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,185
Was this the start?

387
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,855
It wasn't enough
he stressed me out until I died,

388
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,857
he had an affair with my friend.

389
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,528
I was just kidding.

390
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,990
It's not like you could do that
with another man.

391
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,243
Don't take this the wrong way.

392
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,663
I'm just saying that you're not young.

393
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,334
If you step back now,
you can't work again.

394
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,753
That's a huge career break.

395
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,379
You love work.

396
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,466
You don't want to become
some old stay-at-home lady.

397
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,759
Having a baby now

398
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,387
is like clipping the wings
off of a free bird.

399
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,975
If I hadn't known you'd sponge off of me
after quitting your job,

400
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,852
your words would be plausible.

401
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,105
Get an abortion.

402
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,732
As for the fee...

403
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,485
Fine.

404
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:05,904
I'll pay for half.

405
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,533
-Half?
-If you're going to do it anyway,

406
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,868
do it quickly for your body.

407
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,370
Also, I don't want kids.

408
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:15,997
Nothing good can come from it.

409
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,835
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

410
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,920
How dare you sever that?

411
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,766
I'm not pregnant.

412
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,061
It's gastritis.

413
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,276
You're not pregnant?

414
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,238
It's gastritis? I see.

415
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,452
Then why are you so sensitive?

416
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,624
Let's break up.

417
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,335
-What?
-Are you done talking?

418
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,681
Are you done talking?

419
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,477
I tried to be understanding
when you were acting crazy today.

420
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,062
And you want to break up?

421
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,189
Let go of me!

422
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,565
You little...

423
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,028
Did I say something wrong?

424
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,863
Why are you being hysterical?

425
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,448
-I forgot.
-Are you crazy?

426
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,866
Park Min-hwan

427
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,326
doesn't care if I die.

428
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,870
But can't stand the idea of breaking up.

429
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,998
Let go of me and talk!

430
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,834
Who do you think you are
to break up with me?

431
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,252
I'm going to kill you.

432
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,005
Tell me. What is it?

433
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:51,968
Tell me.

434
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,304
Do you think you can break up with me?

435
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,764
How dare you say that.

436
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,474
Tell me. Why?

437
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,559
Tell me.

438
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,647
Is anyone there? Someone, help me!

439
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,737
Help!

440
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:13,531
Please help me!

441
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,534
Miss?

442
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:20,121
You can't come to the police station
over a lover's quarrel.

443
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:22,374
It's not like that. He almost...

444
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,708
I know. I get it.

445
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,044
But eight out of ten women

446
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,588
ask us why we're doing this to their men.

447
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,465
How ridiculous is that for us?

448
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,383
You know, sir.

449
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:34,594
There are days
when women are sensitive for no reason.

450
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,888
I'll apologize on her behalf.

451
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,474
You weren't hit, and nothing's broken.

452
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,394
I see your boyfriend works
for a big company.

453
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:47,065
You can't come to the police
just because you got angry and sensitive--

454
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:47,983
Excuse me.

455
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,361
Do I have to come here
after something's broken?

456
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,114
Forget it.

457
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,157
Can you at least take me home?

458
00:43:07,711 --> 00:43:09,045
It can't be like this.

459
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,553
BALANCE: 718,916 WON

460
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
What am I supposed to do?

461
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,266
BALANCE: 718,916 WON
RECIPIENT: PARK MIN-HWAN

462
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,560
At this time, I was scared to break up.

463
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,395
So I did whatever he wanted.

464
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:28,023
He already has a lot of my money.

465
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,275
He's used my card and cash loans.

466
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:32,902
What do I do?

467
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,112
I can't see a way.

468
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,281
I already settled my severance pay.

469
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,034
I can't run away with 700,000 won.

470
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,368
I won't last a month.

471
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,165
I'm sorry I got mad and yelled.

472
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,542
-But you're at fault too.
-What the hell?

473
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,336
I meant what I said earlier.

474
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,087
I was going to buy you a bag

475
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,006
once the stocks do well.

476
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,300
I got inside information on Roijental.

477
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,177
He's crazy.

478
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,554
Let's get married after this.

479
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:09,147
I'm going into stocks.
Do you remember Roijental?

480
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,315
Roijental?

481
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:13,610
Roijental?

482
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,362
Why didn't I think of that?

483
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,656
Roijental!

484
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,867
The only success in Min-hwan's life.

485
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,244
I see a way now.

486
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,248
I'll use this to get through this for now.

487
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,459
I don't remember everything

488
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,960
that happened since 2013,

489
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,634
but I know what was successful.

490
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,843
I can do this.

491
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,390
I'm going to live a proper life this time.
For real.

492
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,653
I told you.

493
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:59,239
You didn't have to do the scan.

494
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,657
It's just gastritis.

495
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,992
It's serious, so take your meds.

496
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,285
Don't be stressed.

497
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,205
Yes, sir.

498
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,881
Okay.

499
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,467
I just need to maintain my health.

500
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,972
READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO QUIT YOUR JOB

501
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,205
READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO QUIT YOUR JOB

502
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,835
Sir?

503
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,880
"Retiring With Stocks Isn't a Crime."

504
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,798
"Will You Die as a Salaryman?"

505
00:45:58,882 --> 00:46:00,925
"Read This if You Want to Quit Your Job."

506
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:05,472
Do you plan on quitting?

507
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,724
No.

508
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,483
Is that by chance...

509
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,152
Did you get hurt yesterday?

510
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,030
I'm so sorry. I was so out of it.

511
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,493
Buy me a meal if you're sorry.

512
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,077
I like gukbap.

513
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:42,884
What's wrong?

514
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:45,720
What?

515
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,973
When you said a gukbap restaurant,

516
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:52,227
I didn't think it'd look like this.

517
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,187
Are there others?

518
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,775
No.

519
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,861
I never spoke with him before,
so I didn't know.

520
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,489
He's very...

521
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,698
Thank you.

522
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,743
You can tell he's super classy.

523
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,704
Let's eat.

524
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:26,177
How is it?

525
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,685
A lot better than I thought.

526
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,855
You haven't tried it yet.

527
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,482
What are you referring to?

528
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,905
I meant the food.

529
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,411
Thank you.

530
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,584
Was he always like this?

531
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:01,546
He's more handsome and considerate
than I remember. Also...

532
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,008
Did you go to the hospital?

533
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,176
Yeah, I just did.

534
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,178
Then I stopped by the bookstore.

535
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,600
Thank you for yesterday.

536
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,978
You took me home,

537
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,606
and bought me
the cup noodle and chamomile--

538
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,441
You're different today.

539
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,444
I am?

540
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,738
Are you really going to quit?

541
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,367
I was considering it.

542
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,746
I can't keep going like this.

543
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:39,667
I figured it was time for a change.

544
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,087
-Marriage?
-What?

545
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,674
You bought a book about interior.
I just assumed.

546
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,092
MASTER INTERIOR DESIGN

547
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:49,761
No, that's not...

548
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,890
True, I was preparing
to marry Park Min-hwan this year.

549
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,479
I do have to think about marriage.

550
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,023
In that I'd rather die than do it.

551
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,199
Actually...

552
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,954
OTHER HALF

553
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,850
It's okay.

554
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,107
Ji-won, call me right back, over.

555
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:50,029
Why won't she pick up?

556
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,323
She caused a scene at work yesterday.

557
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,544
You're my only friend, Ji-won.

558
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,926
Where the hell is she?
Why won't she answer?

559
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,314
It's the same scar.

560
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,074
I'm so sorry!

561
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:38,870
The scar looks bad.

562
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,623
It's fine.

563
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,712
Let's go.

564
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,756
Okay.

565
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,887
Thanks for the meal.

566
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,138
That makes us even.

567
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,931
One meal was enough.

568
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,809
Okay.

569
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,979
Also...

570
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,526
You are a very talented person.

571
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,863
Getting married
and starting a family is nice,

572
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,823
but I think it'd be a shame if you quit.

573
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,452
As your boss.

574
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:28,336
Thank you.

575
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,465
Now, if you'll excuse me.

576
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,634
Okay. Bye.

577
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:59,534
WORK, MEAL KIT, STOCKS

578
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,160
MEAL KIT

579
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,712
You are a very talented person.

580
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,094
I was scared of him
because he was always frowning.

581
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,222
But he's a pretty decent person.

582
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,852
How did he know I was talented?

583
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,730
I had forgotten

584
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:34,151
that I was good at my job.

585
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,071
I wanted to do a lot of things at work.

586
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,366
Things I had to give up
after getting married

587
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,245
because I didn't want
to discourage Park Min-hwan.

588
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,539
Things Kang Ji-won wanted to do.

589
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:57,717
KANG JI-WON

590
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,220
What's her deal?

591
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:02,930
She's pissing me off again.

592
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,864
Why do I have to go through this
because of Min-hwan?

593
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,212
Get to work, everyone!

594
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,299
Work starts in ten minutes.
You should all be ready.

595
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,717
I'm watching you all.

596
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,802
Get to work! Got it?

597
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,347
Kang Ji-won.

598
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,434
Kang Ji-won!

599
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,240
ROIJENTAL

600
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,327
QUANTITY: FULL AMOUNT

601
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,538
PURCHASE

602
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,999
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE?
YES

603
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,251
Wow, it went up even more.

604
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,087
How far will it rise?

605
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,881
Ji-won.

606
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,516
I thought you'd call last night.

607
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,853
What did you do?

608
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,275
Last night?

609
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,278
You know MODU Community.

610
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,032
I was browsing
the Marriage, In-laws & Family Board,

611
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:46,367
and I lost track of time.

612
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,578
I see.

613
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:54,792
There's this woman
who has late stage cancer.

614
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,963
She saw her husband and her friend in bed.

615
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:03,050
Really? That's crazy.

616
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,428
It is, isn't it?

617
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:10,307
Wow, that friend is worse
than the husband. So gross.

618
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,810
How could she do that to her best friend?

619
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:14,562
I know.

620
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,401
She's going to die anyway,
so she probably thought it was okay.

621
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,660
You can have everything I own if I die.

622
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:31,787
But if you die, I will too.

623
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:38,961
-Kang Ji-won.
-Yes?

624
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,266
When will you get your touch back?

625
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,021
You don't like my proposal?
Is it that bad?

626
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,440
"Bad"?

627
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:02,568
That would be saying it nicely.
This just sucks.

628
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,361
It sucks!

629
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:10,576
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

630
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:15,414
This was turned down at this time.

631
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:16,957
However,

632
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,128
Su-min proposed it without changing
a single word and he proceeded it.

633
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,213
Ji-won.

634
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,800
This is great!

635
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,053
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

636
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:33,349
She became a full-time employee with this
and got promoted.

637
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,851
Does this make sense to you?

638
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,561
Single household? Meal kit?

639
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,897
Why would someone living alone cook?

640
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,942
"Add water to a pot and boil it"?
How bothersome.

641
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:46,028
And the green onions are vacuum-sealed?

642
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:47,988
Jeez, freeze-dried squid?

643
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,492
Opening all these packages
will take a whole day!

644
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:53,327
Does this make sense to you?

645
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,831
The development team will say,
"Do it yourself if you can!"

646
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,459
-What do I do?
-Manager Kim Gyeong-uk.

647
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:02,878
He's rude and incompetent.

648
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,547
He's an opportunist.

649
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,132
Who was it again?

650
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,926
He has relations with a famous higher-up.

651
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,219
Who am I talking to?

652
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,847
Ms. Kang?

653
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,598
What are you thinking about?

654
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:19,270
If you tell me what it lacks,
I'll edit it.

655
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:23,065
This is the problem with women.
They're so dependent!

656
00:57:23,149 --> 00:57:25,484
You need to figure it out yourself.

657
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:29,071
Also, try to be considerate of others
when you come to work.

658
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,448
Why are you dressed like that?

659
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,702
Ms. Yang's like that because she's married

660
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,036
but you're not.

661
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,664
How are the men supposed to take it?

662
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,709
This is because
women don't do military service.

663
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:45,337
Our country should make women serve too.

664
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:46,881
Right, Mr. Park?

665
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,799
Yes, I'll proceed with it.

666
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,384
Right?

667
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,303
Fix this and bring it back.

668
00:58:17,036 --> 00:58:20,581
She's Kim Gyeong-uk's right-hand person,
so we barely spoke.

669
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,958
But she's a good employee.

670
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,795
Mr. Kim prevented her promotion
until she quit the company,

671
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:30,090
but she deserved to be a manager.

672
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:33,886
-Excuse me--
-Ms. Yang.

673
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,680
Mr. Kim's looking for you.

674
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,017
This is nice!

675
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:28,857
-Let's talk.
-No.

676
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:29,942
But, I...

677
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,444
Damn it.

678
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,831
Goodness!

679
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,250
Be careful.

680
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,836
Are you okay? You suddenly jumped out!

681
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,130
What was that? Something just...

682
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,965
No, I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

683
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,550
I'm sorry.

684
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,357
It felt the same. I'm sure of it.

685
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,403
It was the same spot too.

686
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:18,032
No.

687
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,492
That's not possible. What am I thinking?

688
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,872
Hey.

689
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,082
Hey!

690
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,752
Hey, Ji-won! Hey!

691
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,879
Kang Ji-won!

692
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:36,550
Are you okay?

693
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,312
Eventually, I got hurt.

694
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,606
In the same exact spot.

695
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,235
I avoided it, but I couldn't avoid it.

696
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:02,117
Wait, does that mean...

697
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:09,917
No.

698
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:14,129
But my injury is gone.

699
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,592
I once burned myself
because I was so anxious

700
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,637
I might've been pregnant
and spilled some hot water.

701
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,140
What does this mean?
I'm missing something.

702
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,494
ASSISTANT MANAGER PARK MIN-HWAN
IMAGE SENT

703
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,298
SELL

704
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:00,467
PARK MIN-HWAN
ROIJENTAL

705
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,307
ROIJENTAL
PREVIOUS SALE: 81,415

706
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,017
You sold Roijental?

707
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:10,519
Let's talk.

708
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,563
Are you ignoring me?

709
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,440
You're being so rude!

710
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:19,319
Hey. I sold my stocks.

711
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,988
To pay you back.

712
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,614
I deposited it. Check it.

713
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,741
If TKU Technology does well,

714
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:27,244
it'll be huge, so I don't regret this.

715
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,080
Just remember
I sold incredible stocks for you.

716
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:33,000
That's who you are to me.

717
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,419
TKU Technology?

718
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,214
The ruling and opposing lawmakers
involved in the TKU list...

719
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:42,593
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know about TKU.

720
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,470
It was a famous Pump and Dump.

721
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,014
The CEO ends up running off abroad

722
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,765
and the stock gets delisted.

723
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,642
He sold Roijental,

724
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,436
and bought TKU?

725
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,063
I bought Roijental.

726
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,857
And Park Min-hwan sold it.

727
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:59,568
Let's start the meeting for Team One.

728
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,030
Bring the survey data for the new product.

729
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,615
Yes, sir.

730
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,301
Wow, it went up again.

731
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,470
Hey. I sold my stocks.

732
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,440
What's bound to happen will happen.

733
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,408
How's your injury?

734
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,831
It just needs to happen to somebody.

735
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:56,583
You're always getting hurt.

736
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,919
I thought I was having a heart attack.

737
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,838
Are you listening to me?

738
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:11,056
Su-min.

739
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,520
I have some trash to throw away.

740
01:04:17,396 --> 01:04:18,730
Will you do it for me?

741
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,567
What are you talking about?

742
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:24,486
Please.

743
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,030
You're my other half.

744
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,535
Okay.

745
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,996
In return, let's hang out this weekend.

746
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,751
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

747
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,178
Yeah, let's do it.

748
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,102
As long as you throw out my trash.

749
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,564
Okay.

750
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,653
Assistant Manager Kang and Ms. Jeong.
Hurry up.

751
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,155
Coming.

752
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,798
You've been coveting my trash.

753
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,932
You take it out.

754
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,316
Marry my husband.

755
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,168
I need someone to steal my fate.

756
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,463
If anyone, it has to be you.

757
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,298
Ji-won, this is no fun.

758
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:09,341
I hate it.

759
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,134
If things didn't go your way,

760
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,470
you'd behave perversely. I knew that.

761
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,263
Mr. Park, you're a competent man.

762
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,974
What perfume do you use?

763
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:18,934
You're dead today.

764
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,936
That passionate love of yours...

765
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,479
I'll help make it come true.

766
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,272
Do you have plans this weekend?

767
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:25,607
You come first, Ms. Kang.

768
01:06:25,691 --> 01:06:27,442
Just remember that you owe me.

769
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,071
Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?
That crazy old fart.

770
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,448
I won't just take it anymore.

771
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,082
