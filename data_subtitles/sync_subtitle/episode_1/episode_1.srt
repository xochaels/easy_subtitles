1
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,604
Cold wind isn't good for you.

2
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,070
Ji-won.

3
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,156
You're still so pretty.

4
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,539
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

5
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,833
Don't forget you have me.

6
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,126
You have to live a long life with me.

7
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,839
Thanks.

8
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,843
I got unlucky in my marriage,
but I'm glad I have you.

9
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,932
Why would you say that?

10
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,767
Min-hwan's a great husband.

11
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,980
-He's cheating on me.
-What?

12
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,024
He texted me
"I love you" and "I miss you."

13
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,069
Then he deleted it right away.

14
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:36,072
I'm sure it was sent by mistake.

15
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,326
Don't get sensitive.

16
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,754
Do you want me to talk to him?

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,050
Forget it. I just need you.

18
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,721
I only need you too.

19
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,851
Let's only think good thoughts.
Okay, my other half?

20
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,233
Ms. Kang Ji-won,
it's time to go to the transfusion room.

21
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,614
This medicine won't hurt at all.

22
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,657
You'll get better once it's done.

23
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,453
Never give up.

24
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,130
CHEMOTHERAPY

25
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,863
I can't remember the last time
I was happy.

26
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,282
So why do I miss it so much?

27
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,995
I was given six months.

28
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,706
Twelve months, if there was a miracle.

29
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,378
It's all pointless now.

30
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,435
Great job. You look so beautiful today.

31
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,358
You look beautiful.

32
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,112
I picked the perfect dress for you!

33
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,164
Forget it. You're part of our family now.

34
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,374
You're my daughter.

35
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,586
You poor thing.

36
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,340
It's not your fault that you didn't
receive proper household discipline.

37
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,927
As your mother, I'll teach you now.

38
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,431
You pitiful girl.

39
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,857
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

40
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,025
Three generations!

41
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,068
How dare you sever that?

42
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,319
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:25,241
I took in a worthless girl like you.
Why can't you have kids?

44
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,203
Do you even know how to do anything?

45
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,082
-Mom, bear with her.
-Let go.

46
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,047
What a waste. Sit down.
Why are you so angry?

47
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,007
DUGA HOLDINGS

48
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,010
What? You quit your job?

49
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,095
I'm going into stocks.

50
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,097
Do you remember Roijental? Look.

51
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,143
A few more trades,
and it could change our lives.

52
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,063
But I can't trade when I need to
because of work.

53
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,273
It won't work for me.

54
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,400
We have monthly loan payments!

55
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,152
We should've discussed this!

56
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,404
Hey! Are you messing with me?

57
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,699
Why would I have to discuss this with you?

58
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Mom!

59
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,581
Do you think I'll do well?
Do you think I'll hit it big?

60
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,418
Of course. My son can do anything.

61
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,505
Issues at home?
Does the world revolve around you?

62
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,840
Everyone here has issues at home.

63
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,927
This is why married woman shouldn't work.

64
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,764
What are you doing?

65
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,766
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,087
You said you'd fix the lock today.

67
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,131
Do I look like a bum?

68
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,885
Working overtime every day

69
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,971
doesn't mean you're good at your job.

70
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,558
You're so busy running around
because you're so bad at it.

71
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,143
Know your place.

72
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,311
Don't you hear the washing machine?

73
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,604
I started it,

74
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,731
-so you could've taken out--
-Jeez.

75
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,649
Hey!

76
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,944
I've been working all day,
and I just sat down.

77
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,779
I won't do it.

78
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,165
It's stage 4 gastric cancer.

79
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,293
Things don't look good.

80
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,511
You poor thing.

81
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,430
My poor son.

82
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,975
Why did you have to marry her?

83
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:59,478
This is why you have to pick
people carefully.

84
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,275
I thought things were looking up.
How could I be so unlucky?

85
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,903
Mom, if Ji-won has cancer,

86
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,362
who will make my meals?

87
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,325
You're too nice!
Why would you worry about that?

88
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,203
People need to work to overcome illness.

89
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,206
Technology is advanced these days.
She'll be fine.

90
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:20,625
Right?

91
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:24,378
Don't think about telling your company.
Work until you can.

92
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,133
Don't think about acting emotionally
just because you're sick.

93
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,384
It's a nuisance!

94
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,304
Can't they just zap it out?

95
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,224
It'll be fine. We've got technology.

96
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,268
Cancer is no big deal nowadays.

97
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,484
Your therapy is finished.

98
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,407
EPISODE 1

99
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,374
Don't worry about your husband's affair.

100
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,252
It's better off without them
when you're older.

101
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,674
You're not well.
Don't think about bad things.

102
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,053
You have a great friend.

103
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,846
She's so pretty and pleasant.

104
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,521
You're right. I have a great friend.

105
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,292
She's a good worker too.

106
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,128
She's a manager at U&K.

107
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:50,298
It's the company I worked at.

108
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,824
To be honest, I lack a lot of things.

109
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,413
Babe!

110
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,470
But Su-min was the only one
who stayed by my side.

111
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,900
She's always been,

112
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,944
and she always will.

113
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,200
Ms. Kang Ji-won?

114
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,078
Well...

115
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,165
Your guardian must come
if you want to continue treatment.

116
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,835
They need to come pay or take you home.

117
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,718
I'm very sorry.

118
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,221
Please settle it by the end of the day.

119
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,807
The person you are trying to call...

120
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,814
Pick up.

121
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,070
The person you are trying...

122
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,655
Did you take the deposit?

123
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,031
Answer the phone.

124
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,325
I'm begging you. Pick up the phone.

125
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,705
You quit your job after we got married,

126
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,040
so I had to support us, but forget that.

127
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,168
But at least pay the hospital bills.

128
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,294
Answer the phone.

129
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:03,431
PYEONGAN MEDICAL CENTER

130
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,768
TAXI
VACANT

131
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,231
Heungma-dong, Haeyeong Villa.

132
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,784
Goodness. You must be really sick.

133
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,953
You'll get better.

134
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,081
Spring has come.

135
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,958
I won't get better.

136
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm dying.

137
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,921
Stop it.

138
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,089
You can't say bad things like that.

139
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,925
The doctors told me.

140
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
It's true.

141
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,930
Nothing good can come from living.

142
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,890
Why would you say that?

143
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,436
TAXI DRIVER CERTIFICATION
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

144
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,189
My father passed away early.

145
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,399
I don't have siblings.

146
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,653
I barely have a husband.

147
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,197
No.

148
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,284
It would've been better not to have one.

149
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,747
Then...

150
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:56,752
I wouldn't have any debt,
and I'd be able to pay my hospital bills.

151
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:07,471
You need to follow your path
until the very end to know for sure.

152
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,604
Excuse me. This isn't the way.

153
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,316
I'll take you down a good path.
Just trust me.

154
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,256
See? We're here.

155
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,383
I told you.

156
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,677
The path you know isn't the only one.

157
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,930
There are other paths.

158
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,557
That path could be better.

159
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,025
HAEYEONG VILLA

160
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,154
9,600 WON

161
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,989
Thank you.

162
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,908
Wait just a moment.

163
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,379
Ma'am?

164
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,051
This is my last day as a taxi driver.

165
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,722
Take it. Think of it
as an allowance from your dad.

166
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,350
You'll gain energy in no time.

167
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,936
You'll be running around,
making big money.

168
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,979
You'll meet someone

169
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,566
who would die for you
and have a good life.

170
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,028
No, you don't have to do this.

171
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,123
Come on now!

172
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,875
You're hurting an old man's arm!

173
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,075
But I think you're really smart, babe.

174
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,370
How did you think of cancer insurance?

175
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,251
Her dad died of cancer.

176
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,421
She kept getting thinner.

177
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,216
I thought it was time,
so I took out a policy.

178
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,849
Amazing. You did a good job.

179
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,022
Was it a billion won?

180
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,107
Yeah, if she dies.

181
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,404
I already got the diagnostic insurance
and bought you that designer bag.

182
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,617
I put the rest in stocks
to buy you a better bag.

183
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,953
You're so sweet.

184
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,789
Let's buy a house when Ji-won dies.

185
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,374
That sounds nice.

186
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,460
But this bitch is holding out longer
than I thought.

187
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,256
I even didn't tell her to go
to a doctor after I took out the policy.

188
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,301
She's persistent.

189
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,475
Maybe I'll take her out for some air
and push her off somewhere.

190
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,230
No. What if you fall too?

191
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,566
Why not? I can push her gently.

192
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,818
No one would know.

193
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,363
What the hell has she been eating?
Why is she so tenacious?

194
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,490
You should eat whatever she ate.

195
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,910
I don't need to. I'm already strong.

196
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,050
You crazy bastards!

197
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,306
Ji-won?

198
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,099
Babe, are you okay?

199
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,475
Spit it out!

200
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,066
-Are you okay, babe?
-I'm okay.

201
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,987
This is insurance fraud.

202
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,198
I'm going to report you.

203
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,617
Hey!

204
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,868
What the hell?

205
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,662
Babe, are you okay?

206
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,205
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

207
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,290
-Yeah.
-Okay.

208
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,168
I won't forgive you if you leave me.

209
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,629
Jeong Su-min.

210
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,437
I'm going to kill you both!

211
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,857
I'll kill you both!

212
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,359
Hey!

213
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,194
That's enough.

214
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,113
Aren't you sick of this?

215
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,282
Come on.

216
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,493
This little...

217
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,169
Hey.

218
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,882
What the hell can you do right now?

219
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,512
Let's go.

220
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,055
Move out of the way.

221
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,687
Hey!

222
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,781
Come on!

223
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,199
Wait.

224
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
Ji-won.

225
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,512
I'm sorry.

226
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,310
You're sorry?

227
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,146
That's enough.

228
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,029
We can't do anything about it now.

229
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,281
The living should go on living.

230
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,743
You're going to die anyway.

231
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,828
You always think only about yourself.

232
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:26,928
This is great.

233
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,479
You think you won't die?

234
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,440
You don't think it'll happen to you?

235
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,609
-It'll happen to you.
-Stop!

236
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,402
-What?
-Stop it!

237
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,488
Babe!

238
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,447
Hey!

239
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,992
If you're going to die,
just die already. Get lost!

240
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,814
I longed for the happiness I've never had,
yet here I am,

241
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,567
with my good old friend, unhappiness.

242
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,372
Babe.

243
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,749
I think she's dead.

244
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,002
She was going to die anyway.

245
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,754
Does it matter how she dies?

246
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,964
What happens to us?

247
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,090
Stop talking!

248
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,844
People with cancer faint often.

249
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,262
She tripped and fell.

250
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,889
And we found her like this.
We know nothing.

251
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,642
What if we don't get paid?

252
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,810
-Well?
-What now?

253
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,271
I was given six months.

254
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,606
Twelve months, if there was a miracle.

255
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,069
I didn't even get to live that much.

256
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,073
I just died.

257
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,285
APRIL 12, 2023

258
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,343
Babe, what are you doing?

259
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,932
Why are you spacing out?

260
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,520
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?

261
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,454
Did you go to the hospital?

262
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,207
What did they say?

263
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,679
Babe, what's wrong? That hurts!

264
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,139
That hurts!

265
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,858
What's wrong with you?

266
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,819
Hey!

267
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,365
Kang Ji-won, let go! Let go of me!

268
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,908
Let go of me right now!

269
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,326
Ji-won, let go!

270
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,786
God damn it! Let go!

271
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,707
Ms. Kang Ji-won!

272
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,924
Snap out of it.

273
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,009
We're at work. What are you doing?

274
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,554
Work?

275
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
Are you okay?

276
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:21,997
What's going on?

277
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,498
I don't know.

278
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,003
Were you hurt?

279
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:12,714
Just a second.

280
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,633
Kang Ji-won.

281
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,267
Ji-won!

282
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,269
The living should go on living.

283
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,979
You're going to die anyway.

284
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,815
Get lost!

285
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,415
Hey, Ji-won!

286
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,117
Stop.

287
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,128
Can you calm down now?

288
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,217

Where are we?

297
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,632
From the company,

298
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,383
you ran over 200 meters.

299
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,593
You were sprinting.

300
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,891
I should ask you the same.

301
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,437
What's going on?

302
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,764
Do you have something warm at home?

303
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,403
No, I'm fine.

304
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,529
Do you have cash?

305
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,073
You have no phone or wallet.

306
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,867
ASSISTANT MANAGER KANG JI-WON

307
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,791
Take it.

308
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:20,003
There are times you need
someone else's help.

309
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,760

It's all 2013.

313
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,926
It's warm.

314
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,325
Let's me get this straight.

315
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,578
Is this a dream?

316
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,748
If it is a dream, which one is real?

317
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,546
Dying at the hands
of Park Min-hwan in 2023?

318
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:31,759
Or 2013 when I'm 31?

319
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,888
No, 2023 wasn't a dream.

320
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
I...

321
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,602
I know who General Manager Yu Ji-hyuk is.

322
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,107
Mr. Yu Ji-hyuk, how do you feel?

323
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,569
Chairman Yu Ji-hyuk,
who was promoted to CEO of U&K in 2021,

324
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,447
has full ownership
of U&K Food and Finance...

325
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,032
His succession process has been completed.

2021 51ST ANNUAL U&K SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

328
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,335
No one knows right now,

329
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,670
but our general manager...

330
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,172
I will not stop

331
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:13,551
until we become
a global lifestyle company.

332
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,594
...is U&K founder Yu Han-il's grandson.

333
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,804
That's my vision of U&K.

334
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,725
His succession process will begin
in a few years.

335
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,568
The fact that I know this...

336
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,029
Does it mean I travelled back in time?

337
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,868
That's right.

338
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,914
Where's the money he gave me?

339
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,415
Here it is.

340
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,360
Take it. Think of it as an allowance
from your dad.

341
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,575
You can't mark on money.

342
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,127
Dad!

343
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,213
You can't draw on money like that.

344
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,340
Those aren't drawings.

345
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
It's love.

346
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,803
To us, it is love, but you can't do this.

347
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,347
Fine. Don't worry.

348
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,225
I should listen to you.

349
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,977
I'll do everything you want.

350
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,481
I can't believe you.

351
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,089
It's from Dad.

352
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,133
NAME: CHOI NAM-HYEON

353
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,843

00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,102
I'll do it all.

355
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,812
I'll do everything for you!

356
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,404
Dad...

357
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,368
You should have told me it was you.

358
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,788
Why is your face so bloated?

359
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,543
Come out. Let's go eat.

360
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,137
Ji-won, what's going on?

361
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,890
You haven't been picking up
since you ran out.

362
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,767
I'm worried about you.

363
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,560
I'm coming over right now.

364
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,896
I'm not feeling well.

365
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,148
Don't come. I'm with Min-hwan.

366
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,656
Oh, my.

367
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,581
Hey.

368
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,335
You're so immature.

369
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,631
Yeah, I know you have a lot on your mind.
That's okay.

370
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,467
I don't understand,

371
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,636
but women say it happens, so, fine.

372
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,763
I get it.

373
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,974
But you're making it too obvious at work.

374
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,642
Isn't that wrong?

375
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,229
What good can come
from making things bad for me?

376
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,025
Speak so I can understand.

377
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,743
When did it happen?

378
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,121
We haven't done it in a while.

379
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,456
Why are you pregnant?

380
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,626
Are you sure it's mine?

381
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,130
What?

382
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,007
You told me you think you're pregnant.

383
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,135
I remember.

384
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,930
I couldn't stomach anything,
so I thought I was pregnant.

385
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,349
It was gastritis from stress.

386
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,185
Was this the start?

387
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,855
It wasn't enough
he stressed me out until I died,

388
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,857
he had an affair with my friend.

389
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,528
I was just kidding.

390
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,990
It's not like you could do that
with another man.

391
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,243
Don't take this the wrong way.

392
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,663
I'm just saying that you're not young.

393
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,334
If you step back now,
you can't work again.

394
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,753
That's a huge career break.

395
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,379
You love work.

396
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,466
You don't want to become
some old stay-at-home lady.

397
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,759
Having a baby now

398
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,387
is like clipping the wings
off of a free bird.

399
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,975
If I hadn't known you'd sponge off of me
after quitting your job,

400
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,852
your words would be plausible.

401
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,105
Get an abortion.

402
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,732
As for the fee...

403
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,485
Fine.

404
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:06,904
I'll pay for half.

405
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,533
-Half?
-If you're going to do it anyway,

406
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,868
do it quickly for your body.

407
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,370
Also, I don't want kids.

408
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,997
Nothing good can come from it.

409
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,835
Min-hwan's the third generation
of families with only sons.

410
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,920
How dare you sever that?

411
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,766
I'm not pregnant.

412
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,061
It's gastritis.

413
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,276
You're not pregnant?

414
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,238
It's gastritis? I see.

415
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,452
Then why are you so sensitive?

416
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,624
Let's break up.

417
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,335
-What?
-Are you done talking?

418
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,681
Are you done talking?

419
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,477
I tried to be understanding
when you were acting crazy today.

420
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,062
And you want to break up?

421
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,189
Let go of me!

422
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,565
You little...

423
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,028
Did I say something wrong?

424
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,863
Why are you being hysterical?

425
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,448
-I forgot.
-Are you crazy?

426
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,866
Park Min-hwan

427
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,326
doesn't care if I die.

428
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,870
But can't stand the idea of breaking up.

429
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,998
Let go of me and talk!

430
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,834
Who do you think you are
to break up with me?

431
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,252
I'm going to kill you.

432
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,005
Tell me. What is it?

433
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:52,968
Tell me.

434
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,304
Do you think you can break up with me?

435
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,764
How dare you say that.

436
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,474
Tell me. Why?

437
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,559
Tell me.

438
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,647
Is anyone there? Someone, help me!

439
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,737
Help!

440
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,531
Please help me!

441
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,534
Miss?

442
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:21,121
You can't come to the police station
over a lover's quarrel.

443
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:23,374
It's not like that. He almost...

444
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,708
I know. I get it.

445
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,044
But eight out of ten women

446
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,588
ask us why we're doing this to their men.

447
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,465
How ridiculous is that for us?

448
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:32,383
You know, sir.

449
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:35,594
There are days
when women are sensitive for no reason.

450
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,888
I'll apologize on her behalf.

451
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,474
You weren't hit, and nothing's broken.

452
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:43,394
I see your boyfriend works
for a big company.

453
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:48,065
You can't come to the police
just because you got angry and sensitive--

454
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:48,983
Excuse me.

455
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:52,361
Do I have to come here
after something's broken?

456
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,114
Forget it.

457
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,157
Can you at least take me home?

458
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,045
It can't be like this.

459
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,553
BALANCE: 718,916 WON

460
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,097
What am I supposed to do?

461
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,266
BALANCE: 718,916 WON
RECIPIENT: PARK MIN-HWAN

462
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,560
At this time, I was scared to break up.

463
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,395
So I did whatever he wanted.

464
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,023
He already has a lot of my money.

465
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,275
He's used my card and cash loans.

466
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:33,902
What do I do?

467
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,112
I can't see a way.

468
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,281
I already settled my severance pay.

469
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,034
I can't run away with 700,000 won.

470
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,368
I won't last a month.

471
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,165
I'm sorry I got mad and yelled.

472
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,542
-But you're at fault too.
-What the hell?

473
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,336
I meant what I said earlier.

474
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,087
I was going to buy you a bag

475
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,006
once the stocks do well.

476
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,300
I got inside information on Roijental.

477
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,177
He's crazy.

478
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,554
Let's get married after this.

479
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,147
I'm going into stocks.
Do you remember Roijental?

480
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,315
Roijental?

481
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,610
Roijental?

482
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,362
Why didn't I think of that?

483
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,656
Roijental!

484
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,867
The only success in Min-hwan's life.

485
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,244
I see a way now.

486
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:28,248
I'll use this to get through this for now.

487
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
I don't remember everything

488
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,960
that happened since 2013,

489
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,634
but I know what was successful.

490
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,843
I can do this.

491
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,390
I'm going to live a proper life this time.
For real.

492
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,653
I told you.

493
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,239
You didn't have to do the scan.

494
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,657
It's just gastritis.

495
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,992
It's serious, so take your meds.

496
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,285
Don't be stressed.

497
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,205
Yes, sir.

498
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,881
Okay.

499
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,467
I just need to maintain my health.

500
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,972
READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO QUIT YOUR JOB

501
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,205
READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO QUIT YOUR JOB

502
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:54,835
Sir?

503
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:57,880
"Retiring With Stocks Isn't a Crime."

504
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,798
"Will You Die as a Salaryman?"

505
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,925
"Read This if You Want to Quit Your Job."

506
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,472
Do you plan on quitting?

507
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,724
No.

508
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,483
Is that by chance...

509
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,152
Did you get hurt yesterday?

510
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,030
I'm so sorry. I was so out of it.

511
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,493
Buy me a meal if you're sorry.

512
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,077
I like gukbap.

513
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,884
What's wrong?

514
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,720
What?

515
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,973
When you said a gukbap restaurant,

516
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,227
I didn't think it'd look like this.

517
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,187
Are there others?

518
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,775
No.

519
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,861
I never spoke with him before,
so I didn't know.

520
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,489
He's very...

521
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,698
Thank you.

522
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,743
You can tell he's super classy.

523
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,704
Let's eat.

524
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,177
How is it?

525
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
A lot better than I thought.

526
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,855
You haven't tried it yet.

527
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,482
What are you referring to?

528
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,905
I meant the food.

529
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,411
Thank you.

530
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,584
Was he always like this?

531
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,546
He's more handsome and considerate
than I remember. Also...

532
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,008
Did you go to the hospital?

533
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,176
Yeah, I just did.

534
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,178
Then I stopped by the bookstore.

535
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,600
Thank you for yesterday.

536
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,978
You took me home,

537
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,606
and bought me
the cup noodle and chamomile--

538
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,441
You're different today.

539
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,444
I am?

540
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,738
Are you really going to quit?

541
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,367
I was considering it.

542
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,746
I can't keep going like this.

543
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:40,667
I figured it was time for a change.

544
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,087
-Marriage?
-What?

545
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,674
You bought a book about interior.
I just assumed.

546
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,092
MASTER INTERIOR DESIGN

547
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,761
No, that's not...

548
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,890
True, I was preparing
to marry Park Min-hwan this year.

549
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,479
I do have to think about marriage.

550
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,023
In that I'd rather die than do it.

551
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,199
Actually...

552
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,954
OTHER HALF

553
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,850
It's okay.

554
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,107
Ji-won, call me right back, over.

555
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,029
Why won't she pick up?

556
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,323
She caused a scene at work yesterday.

557
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,544
You're my only friend, Ji-won.

558
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,926
Where the hell is she?
Why won't she answer?

559
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,314
It's the same scar.

560
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,074
I'm so sorry!

561
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,870
The scar looks bad.

562
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,623
It's fine.

563
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,712
Let's go.

564
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,756
Okay.

565
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,887
Thanks for the meal.

566
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,138
That makes us even.

567
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,931
One meal was enough.

568
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,809
Okay.

569
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:05,979
Also...

570
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,526
You are a very talented person.

571
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,863
Getting married
and starting a family is nice,

572
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,823
but I think it'd be a shame if you quit.

573
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,452
As your boss.

574
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,336
Thank you.

575
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,465
Now, if you'll excuse me.

576
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,634
Okay. Bye.

577
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,534
WORK, MEAL KIT, STOCKS

578
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,160
MEAL KIT

579
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,712
You are a very talented person.

580
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:19,094
I was scared of him
because he was always frowning.

581
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,222
But he's a pretty decent person.

582
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,852
How did he know I was talented?

583
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,730
I had forgotten

584
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,151
that I was good at my job.

585
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,071
I wanted to do a lot of things at work.

586
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,366
Things I had to give up
after getting married

587
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,245
because I didn't want
to discourage Park Min-hwan.

588
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,539
Things Kang Ji-won wanted to do.

589
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,717
KANG JI-WON

590
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,220
What's her deal?

591
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,930
She's pissing me off again.

592
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,864
Why do I have to go through this
because of Min-hwan?

593
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,212
Get to work, everyone!

594
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,299
Work starts in ten minutes.
You should all be ready.

595
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,717
I'm watching you all.

596
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,802
Get to work! Got it?

597
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,347
Kang Ji-won.

598
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
Kang Ji-won!

599
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,240
ROIJENTAL

600
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,327
QUANTITY: FULL AMOUNT

601
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,538
PURCHASE

602
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,999
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE?
YES

603
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,251
Wow, it went up even more.

604
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,087
How far will it rise?

605
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,881
Ji-won.

606
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,516
I thought you'd call last night.

607
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,853
What did you do?

608
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,275
Last night?

609
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,278
You know MODU Community.

610
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,032
I was browsing
the Marriage, In-laws & Family Board,

611
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,367
and I lost track of time.

612
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,578
I see.

613
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,792
There's this woman
who has late stage cancer.

614
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,963
She saw her husband and her friend in bed.

615
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,050
Really? That's crazy.

616
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,428
It is, isn't it?

617
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:11,307
Wow, that friend is worse
than the husband. So gross.

618
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,810
How could she do that to her best friend?

619
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,562
I know.

620
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,401
She's going to die anyway,
so she probably thought it was okay.

621
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,660
You can have everything I own if I die.

622
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,787
But if you die, I will too.

623
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,961
-Kang Ji-won.
-Yes?

624
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,266
When will you get your touch back?

625
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,021
You don't like my proposal?
Is it that bad?

626
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,440
"Bad"?

627
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,568
That would be saying it nicely.
This just sucks.

628
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,361
It sucks!

629
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,576
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

630
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,414
This was turned down at this time.

631
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,957
However,

632
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:22,128
Su-min proposed it without changing
a single word and he proceeded it.

633
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,213
Ji-won.

634
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,800
This is great!

635
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,053
Can I fix it a little
and propose it again?

636
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,349
She became a full-time employee with this
and got promoted.

637
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,851
Does this make sense to you?

638
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,561
Single household? Meal kit?

639
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,897
Why would someone living alone cook?

640
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,942
"Add water to a pot and boil it"?
How bothersome.

641
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,028
And the green onions are vacuum-sealed?

642
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,988
Jeez, freeze-dried squid?

643
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,492
Opening all these packages
will take a whole day!

644
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,327
Does this make sense to you?

645
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,831
The development team will say,
"Do it yourself if you can!"

646
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,459
-What do I do?
-Manager Kim Gyeong-uk.

647
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,878
He's rude and incompetent.

648
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,547
He's an opportunist.

649
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,132
Who was it again?

650
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,926
He has relations with a famous higher-up.

651
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,219
Who am I talking to?

652
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,847
Ms. Kang?

653
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,598
What are you thinking about?

654
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,270
If you tell me what it lacks,
I'll edit it.

655
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:24,065
This is the problem with women.
They're so dependent!

656
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,484
You need to figure it out yourself.

657
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:30,071
Also, try to be considerate of others
when you come to work.

658
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,448
Why are you dressed like that?

659
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,702
Ms. Yang's like that because she's married

660
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,036
but you're not.

661
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,664
How are the men supposed to take it?

662
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,709
This is because
women don't do military service.

663
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:46,337
Our country should make women serve too.

664
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,881
Right, Mr. Park?

665
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,799
Yes, I'll proceed with it.

666
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,384
Right?

667
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:53,303
Fix this and bring it back.

668
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:21,581
She's Kim Gyeong-uk's right-hand person,
so we barely spoke.

669
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,958
But she's a good employee.

670
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,795
Mr. Kim prevented her promotion
until she quit the company,

671
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,090
but she deserved to be a manager.

672
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,886
-Excuse me--
-Ms. Yang.

673
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,680
Mr. Kim's looking for you.

674
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,017
This is nice!

675
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,857
-Let's talk.
-No.

676
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,942
But, I...

677
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:33,444
Damn it.

678
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,831
Goodness!

679
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,250
Be careful.

680
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,836
Are you okay? You suddenly jumped out!

681
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,130
What was that? Something just...

682
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,965
No, I'm fine. I'm so sorry.

683
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,550
I'm sorry.

684
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,357
It felt the same. I'm sure of it.

685
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,403
It was the same spot too.

686
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,032
No.

687
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,492
That's not possible. What am I thinking?

688
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:25,872
Hey.

689
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,082
Hey!

690
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,752
Hey, Ji-won! Hey!

691
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,879
Kang Ji-won!

692
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,550
Are you okay?

693
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,312
Eventually, I got hurt.

694
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,606
In the same exact spot.

695
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,235
I avoided it, but I couldn't avoid it.

696
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,117
Wait, does that mean...

697
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,917
No.

698
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,129
But my injury is gone.

699
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,592
I once burned myself
because I was so anxious

700
01:01:19,675 --> 01:01:22,637
I might've been pregnant
and spilled some hot water.

701
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,140
What does this mean?
I'm missing something.

702
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:46,494
ASSISTANT MANAGER PARK MIN-HWAN
IMAGE SENT

703
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,298
SELL

704
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,467
PARK MIN-HWAN
ROIJENTAL

705
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,307
ROIJENTAL
PREVIOUS SALE: 81,415

706
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,017
You sold Roijental?

707
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,519
Let's talk.

708
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,563
Are you ignoring me?

709
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:15,440
You're being so rude!

710
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,319
Hey. I sold my stocks.

711
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:21,988
To pay you back.

712
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,614
I deposited it. Check it.

713
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,741
If TKU Technology does well,

714
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,244
it'll be huge, so I don't regret this.

715
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,080
Just remember
I sold incredible stocks for you.

716
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,000
That's who you are to me.

717
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,419
TKU Technology?

718
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:40,214
The ruling and opposing lawmakers
involved in the TKU list...

719
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:43,593
I know nothing about stocks,
but I know about TKU.

720
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,470
It was a famous Pump and Dump.

721
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:48,014
The CEO ends up running off abroad

722
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,765
and the stock gets delisted.

723
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,642
He sold Roijental,

724
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,436
and bought TKU?

725
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,063
I bought Roijental.

726
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,857
And Park Min-hwan sold it.

727
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,568
Let's start the meeting for Team One.

728
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,030
Bring the survey data for the new product.

729
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,615
Yes, sir.

730
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,301
Wow, it went up again.

731
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,470
Hey. I sold my stocks.

732
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,440
What's bound to happen will happen.

733
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:49,408
How's your injury?

734
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,831
It just needs to happen to somebody.

735
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,583
You're always getting hurt.

736
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,919
I thought I was having a heart attack.

737
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,838
Are you listening to me?

738
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,056
Su-min.

739
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,520
I have some trash to throw away.

740
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:19,730
Will you do it for me?

741
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,567
What are you talking about?

742
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,486
Please.

743
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,030
You're my other half.

744
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,535
Okay.

745
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,996
In return, let's hang out this weekend.

746
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,751
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

747
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,178
Yeah, let's do it.

748
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,102
As long as you throw out my trash.

749
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,564
Okay.

750
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,653
Assistant Manager Kang and Ms. Jeong.
Hurry up.

751
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,155
Coming.

752
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,798
You've been coveting my trash.

753
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,932
You take it out.

754
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,316
Marry my husband.

755
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,168
I need someone to steal my fate.

756
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,463
If anyone, it has to be you.

757
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,298
Ji-won, this is no fun.

758
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,341
I hate it.

759
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,134
If things didn't go your way,

760
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,470
you'd behave perversely. I knew that.

761
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,263
Mr. Park, you're a competent man.

762
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,974
What perfume do you use?

763
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:19,934
You're dead today.

764
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,936
That passionate love of yours...

765
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,479
I'll help make it come true.

766
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,272
Do you have plans this weekend?

767
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,607
You come first, Ms. Kang.

768
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,442
Just remember that you owe me.

769
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,071
Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?
That crazy old fart.

770
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,448
I won't just take it anymore.

771
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,082
