1
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,510
Customer 34, your
latte is ready.

2
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:55,055
Customer 35, your iced
Americano is ready.

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,105
There's no iced Americano.

4
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,524
It went out earlier.

5
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:08,068
I think someone else took it.

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,280
Customer 34.

7
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,990
Customer 34.

8
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,326
That's me.

9
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,621
Where did my coffee go?

10
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,373
I'm sorry. I'll make it again.

11
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,884
If no one steals it,

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,727
the coffee remains there.

13
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,940
But if someone takes it...

14
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,984
Are you kidding me? What
do you think you're doing?

15
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:51,445
The coffee will be gone.

16
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:05,668
I need someone to steal my fate.

17
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,307
EPISODE 2

18
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,893
Strike. You know
what that is, right?

19
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,187
When I hit the ball,

20
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,772
it's game over!

21
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:30,901
When I hit it, it goes
out like a bowling ball!

22
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,111
They all go flying.

23
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,781
When I think about it...

24
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,408
Ji-won!

25
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:42,829
If anyone,

26
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,623
it has to be you.

27
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,587
Because you just have to
have everything that's mine.

28
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,055
Hurry up.

29
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,322
Mr. Yu.

30
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,369
Hello.

31
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,195
Did you have a meeting
outside the office?

32
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,323
Ms. Yang said you didn't
come to work today.

33
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,658
Yes, that's right.

34
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,576
Something came up this morning.

35
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,744
I see.

36
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,374
Ji-won, are you working
on your proposal?

37
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,918
I won't hold back
if it sucks again.

38
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,003
I'm working hard on it.

39
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,630
If you say it like that,

40
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,632
it sounds like she's not trying.

41
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,134
Ji-won works so hard.

42
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,388
Isn't that the good coffee?

43
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,182
From the cafÃ©
across the bus stop.

44
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,643
Look at this. You slacker.

45
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,854
You left work during
working hours to buy coffee.

46
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,231
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,693
- I got it on my way back in.
- Women never work.

48
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,152
They only want to eat...

49
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,879
- Ms. Kang?
- Yes?

50
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,048
Just a moment.

51
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,104
Drink your coffee.

52
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,152
Would you like this?

53
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,571
I didn't drink it yet.

54
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,992
To be honest, I
skipped breakfast.

55
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,160
That's why on my...

56
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,287
You should start
eating breakfast.

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,584
Drink it.

58
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,254
It'll be awkward for you
to drink it alone in there.

59
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,673
That's why I called
you out here.

60
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,302
Thank you.

61
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,891
That's right.

62
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,019
I'm not quitting the company.

63
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,025
Do you want to see this?

64
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,989
My dad gave it to me.

65
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,408
Whenever my dad gave
me an allowance,

66
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,494
he always drew a heart on it.

67
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,664
I told him not to draw
on money like that,

68
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,709
but I guess he couldn't
suppress his artistic soul.

69
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,632
I'm a daughter who received
this kind of fatherly love.

70
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,387
I'm going to try harder.

71
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,522
Also...

72
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,401
You said that I was talented.

73
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,363
That really helped me make
up my mind. Thank you.

74
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,537
Honestly, it's been so long.

75
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,789
I forgot what I wanted.

76
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,126
I've been busy just
trying to get by.

77
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,172
But I won't live
like that anymore.

78
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,010
That's a good idea.

79
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,265
Did you just smile?

80
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,102
It's my first time
seeing you smile.

81
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,529
By any chance,

82
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,407
do you have plans this weekend?

83
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,825
This weekend?

84
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,749
No.

85
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,543
- Then...
- I already made plans

86
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,170
with Ji-won this weekend.

87
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,882
Did you forget already? I'm sad.

88
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,469
I booked a table at Goseuljung.
It's a great BBQ restaurant.

89
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,015
Goseuljung?

90
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,391
Yes. Do you know that place?

91
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,355
I've heard of it.

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,026
Okay.

93
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,284
I want that coffee too.

94
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,452
Let's go together.

95
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,289
Sorry, I'm a little
busy right now.

96
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,291
Why? I want to drink it too!

97
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,210
The sandwiches there are good.

98
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,303
Ji-won, this is no fun.

99
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,932
I saved you from Mr. Yu asking
you to work on the weekend,

100
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,308
and you can't even
have coffee with me?

101
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,227
All she does is work.

102
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,270
I hate it.

103
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,376
EMPLOYEE SEARCH

00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,047
NAME: KANG JI-WON

TAEHA HIGH SCHOOL

00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,472
Hi, is this Goseuljung?

108
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,558
I wanted to confirm a
reservation for this weekend.

109
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:21,144
Busan Taeha High School
reunion at six...

110
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,314
Oh, it's at 5:30 p.m.

JO DONG-SUK

112
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,198
Hey, Dong-suk.

113
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,033
Can you find someone for me?

114
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,577
Yes, right now.

115
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,208
I'll call you back later.

116
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,799
Here you go.

117
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:51,882
PAIN RELIEVER

118
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,388
It's a pain reliever.

119
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,683
I heard you should take
it if there's any pain.

120
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,686
Did you take some?

121
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,479
Your injury must hurt.

122
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,567
That's okay. I'm fine.

123
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,324
I'm glad you're prepared, but
take care of yourself first.

124
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,784
I think you need
this more than I do.

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,256
Thank you.

126
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,530
Come out.

127
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,624
I need Jeong Su-min
to steal my fate.

128
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,562
Don't tell me...

129
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,107
Did you dump me for Yu Ji-hyuk?

130
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,775
What?

131
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,986
Yu Ji-hyuk is young and
he's a general manager

132
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,030
so you think he's got power?

133
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,743
You only know half of the
story, you sneaky vixen.

134
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,289
I told you. You need to see
a man's looks and their tact.

135
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,374
Okay?

136
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,169
What's with that look?

137
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,632
You don't have something
with him, do you?

138
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,218
I am sorry, Mr. Yu.

139
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:02,639
Are you being like this because he
asked me to bring him a bandage?

140
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,142
He asked you for a bandage?

141
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,352
That crazy old fart.

142
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,479
How could he do that
to someone hurt?

143
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,981
I won't stand for this.

144
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,610
I asked to break up

145
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,158
because our relationship isn't
the same as it used to be.

146
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,245
I don't know.

147
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,830
I don't want to tell you.

148
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,251
What is it?

149
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,046
Were you upset because you thought
my feelings for you have changed?

150
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,341
Yes.

151
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,638
I want a relationship that
everyone's envious of.

152
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,432
I wish you were someone

153
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,351
that I could be proud of

154
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,062
and any women would
want to steal.

155
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,731
What?

156
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:56,234
Who cares what others think?
Our feelings are what matter.

157
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,155
Ji-won. You...

158
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,824
I thought you were being
silly. I was wrong.

159
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,535
Okay.

160
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,038
I'll pay more
attention from now on.

161
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's make up.

162
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,709
- Okay.
- Yeah.

163
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,629
What is it? What?

164
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,713
Let's make up.

165
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,340
But why at work?

166
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,466
No one's coming.

167
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,967
- Yes, they will.
- No.

168
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,347
Wait, I'm getting a call.

169
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,849
It's just my mom
calling to take my meds.

170
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,687
This won't do.

171
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,742
Oh, hi.

172
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,578
It's resolved.

173
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,007
I...

174
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,512
I know it's not my place.

175
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,806
But even between lovers,

176
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,310
unwanted physical
contact is bad.

177
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,689
So...

178
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,899
I was just reminded of my past.

179
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,068
I have a lot of regrets.

180
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,281
You're a smart person.

181
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,242
Don't make mistakes like I did.

182
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,336
Did she come because she
was worried about me?

183
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,052
Now, it's time for lunch.

184
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,596
Let's work after we eat.

185
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,140
Ms. Yang!

186
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,933
Did you make the reservation?

187
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,277
Babe, what should we eat?

188
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,862
I crave curry today.

189
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,281
Let's get Indian.

190
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,409
Sorry, I'm broke lately.

191
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,203
Also, we have stir-fried
pork at the cafeteria.

192
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,498
Min-hwan, take
Su-min to get Indian.

193
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,587
No, if you want to
eat stir-fried pork,

194
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,047
then I'll eat that too.

195
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,132
Yeah, okay.

196
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,176
Then let's go to the cafeteria.

197
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,151
Thank you, my other half.

198
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,327
Here.

199
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,089
If things didn't go your way,

200
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,509
you'd behave
perversely. I knew that.

201
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,308
Let's sit there.

202
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,148
Come on. You should
be more careful.

203
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,317
Ji-won, are you okay?

204
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,528
Ji-won, are you okay?

205
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,029
What do we do?

206
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,532
I endured it because

207
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,951
I thought you were
the only one I had.

208
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,037
- I'm sorry.
- You should've dodged it, silly.

209
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,873
What do we do?

210
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,380
Let's sit over there.

211
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,353
Come on!

212
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,897
Damn it.

213
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,941
Damn it.

214
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,777
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

215
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,194
Are you okay?

216
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,823
I'm so sorry!

217
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,617
Su-min, sorry.

218
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,661
Did you trip over my foot?

219
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,539
Babe.

220
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,500
- Are you hurt?
- Damn it.

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,378
Isn't this your favorite shirt?

222
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,508
Authentique?

223
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,969
It's all ruined now.

224
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,345
What do we do?

225
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,930
Get me a napkin.

226
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,099
Napkin. Right.

227
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,021
I won't just take it anymore.

228
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,774
Excuse me!

229
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,567
Is someone there?

230
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,861
Me?

231
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,488
Yes!

232
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,656
Can I

233
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,617
ask you for a favor?

234
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,579
Do you need a sanitary pad?

235
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,664
Yes!

236
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,749
Yes!

237
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,794
Just a moment. I'll
get it for you.

238
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,590
Thank you! Thank you so much!

239
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,841
Thank you so much!

240
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,845
I was wondering

241
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,390
who saved my life, and it's
someone I already knew!

242
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,560
I promise to serve
you properly one day!

243
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,730
There's no need for
that. It was nothing.

244
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,235
Hui-yeon, just a second.

245
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,778
Excuse me.

246
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,490
I knew it.

247
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,760
Okay.

248
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,637
How are you so nice?

249
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,392
You're a good Samaritan. I
thought they don't exist anymore.

250
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,477
The type of kindness
you only see in films.

251
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,189
You're the light of my
life! My real savior!

252
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,070
Have you always been like this?

253
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,363
Goodness.

254
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,866
You're beautiful when you smile.

255
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,993
Why didn't I know that?

256
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,912
You're beautiful and nice.

257
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,248
You live an impressive life.

258
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,794
You're overdoing it.

259
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,046
Other people would've
done the same.

260
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,257
No, they wouldn't.

261
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,510
Someone came in before you did,

262
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,470
and I sincerely asked for help.

263
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,307
But she just grumbled.

264
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
She finished her
business and left.

265
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,521
Thank you, my other half.

266
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:57,071
Have you eaten?

267
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,656
I haven't yet.

268
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,284
I came down to eat unprepared.

269
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,162
That's when I fell
into a crisis.

270
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,497
That's right.

271
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:10,418
That reminds me. Why haven't
we had a meal together yet?

272
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,672
If it's okay with you,
shall we eat together?

273
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,684
You left to get napkins.

274
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,895
I wondered what
took you so long.

275
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,151
She was in an emergency too.

276
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,153
What kind of emergency?

277
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,155
Well...

278
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,658
We figured it out too.

279
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,952
You handled it well.

280
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,038
You think?

281
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,042
I bet Min-hwan is pissed.

282
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,670
He begged me for a
year to buy that shirt.

283
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,797
I'm really sorry, Mr. Park.

284
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,508
I'll buy you another one.

285
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,177
It's fine.

286
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,845
It's just a shirt.

287
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,222
Don't worry about it.

288
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,059
Isn't that a luxury brand?

289
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,645
Isn't it 1.5 million
won? No, 1.8 million?

290
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,775
It's not that expensive. A
little over 1.2 million won.

291
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,445
- Well...
- What do I do?

292
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,824
I'm a contract worker, so
I don't make that much.

293
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,543
It's fine. Don't worry
about it. Please, just eat.

294
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,253
Is it really okay?

295
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,172
Well, you're a really
competent man, so...

296
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,258
- You're the best.
- You too, Su-min.

297
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,052
I should go buy a shirt.

298
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,555
Eat up. I have a lot
of shirts at home.

299
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,181
You're so generous.

300
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,767
I wanted this to happen.
It smells so good.

301
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,563
Mr. Park, you're the best.

302
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,711
Be careful of the fire.

303
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:19,213
Slice some more onions.

304
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,508
Good. Keep going.

305
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,843
Hey, this is burning.

306
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,138
It'll burn if you
leave it. Do it again.

307
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,867
Thank you for coming.

308
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,951
It's so good.

309
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,036
Thank you.

310
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,595
Chef Baek Eun-ho.

311
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,681
Yes?

312
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,978
Did you graduate from
Busan's Taeha High School?

313
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:19,023
Yes, I did.

314
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,199
Hui-yeon, you've got
quite the appetite.

315
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,535
You really do.

316
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,246
How can a woman eat so much?

317
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:35,540
Women or men,

318
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:38,084
we must eat a lot to
do important work.

319
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,044
My grandfather taught me this.

320
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,507
So? Does your grandfather
do important work?

321
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,426
He sells bean sprouts.

322
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,928
Tofu and seasonings too.

323
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,641
So he sells side dishes.

324
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,353
You must be energetic
thanks to him, Hui-yeon.

325
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,522
Koreans get their
energy from rice.

326
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,482
That's right!

327
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,069
As a picky eater, I'm doomed.

328
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,406
How will you work
after eating that?

329
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,740
You eat too little.

330
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:11,534
I know.

331
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,619
I should eat well like Ji-won.

332
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,079
Come to think of it,

333
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:17,582
Ji-won was always able
to eat everything.

334
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,084
She could digest steel.

335
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,421
- Right, Ji-won?
- Yes.

336
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,089
Is that true?

337
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,885
I remember when she
ate pork gukbap.

338
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,428
She eats like an old man.

339
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,471
She was gobbling it up.

340
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,015
Hey, old man!

341
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,476
Min-hwan, you
shouldn't say that.

342
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,270
You need to love
her no matter what.

343
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,563
Love.

344
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,648
Right. Love's important.

345
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,403
You're lucky to have
a friend like that.

346
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,659
Yeah, Su-min's the best.

347
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,994
Why do men...

348
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,580
I'll bring you some water.

349
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,291
- Mine too.
- What? Why should I?

350
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,501
Since you're going anyway.

351
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,296
- Mine too...
- Since you came to work anyway,

352
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,797
could you do my job too?

353
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,053
What the...

354
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:13,888
That little...

355
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:17,558
How dare that little
chick talk like that?

356
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,144
Don't call her like that.

357
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,438
We're at work.

358
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,107
She's young, but she's
the same rank as you.

359
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,360
What?

360
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:33,908
Well...

361
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,119
Still, I'll talk to her.

362
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,163
Yeah. Talk to her, will you?

363
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,749
She's so rude. Unbelievable.

364
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,044
Finish it up with Su-min.
I'll see you upstairs.

365
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,921
You know she's a picky eater.

366
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,090
She won't eat unless
someone helps.

367
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,299
She's not like me.

368
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:52,802
Sure, okay.

369
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,804
See you later.

370
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,983
Hui-yeon, I'm sorry.

371
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,318
I cleared your
tray. Are you okay?

372
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,946
I'm so sorry. I
should've held it in.

373
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,660
I saw it right away.

374
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,121
The woman who ignored
me in the restroom

375
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,372
was Jeong Su-min.

376
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,962
Hi, stranger who just came in.

377
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,090
By chance, can you help me?

378
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,427
Why would she ask for help?
She should've come prepared.

379
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,471
Such a nuisance!

380
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,105
Shall we get coffee
after the meeting?

381
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,566
- I'll buy!
- I said I'd buy.

382
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,160
I think Ji-won is angry.

383
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,247
I think it's because
I ruined your shirt.

384
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,167
Come on.

385
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,210
You know she's not like that.

386
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:11,380
She was worried about
how you eat earlier.

387
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,883
She cares about you so much.

388
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,052
You think so?

389
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,389
Ji-won's so
indifferent sometimes.

390
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,435
She doesn't know
how much I like her.

391
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,483
Come on.

392
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,109
It's really okay.

393
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,447
- Let's go.
- Go in.

394
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,700
Goodness!

395
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,539
My hands...

396
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,416
Right.

397
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,261
This...

398
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,681
What do we do about it?

399
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,642
Right, well...

400
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,815
No, wait.

401
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,525
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

402
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,151
Sorry about that.

403
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,241
What perfume

404
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,452
do you use?

405
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,080
This is...

406
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,209
You smell nice.

407
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,544
Yeah, well...

408
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,475
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

409
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,477
Okay.

410
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,439
What do you think you're doing?

411
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,733
Excuse me?

412
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,987
These are the materials
for the meeting.

413
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,323
I told you not to do this.

414
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:02,950
Well?

415
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:05,911
Let's be honest.

416
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,622
The proposals you
all write are lame.

417
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,041
Just show some sincerity

418
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,544
so we can have a
meeting in peace!

419
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,755
Does this make sense to you?

420
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,175
- Does it?
- Those who are incompetent focus

421
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,845
on the little things they know
and make a huge deal out of it.

422
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,556
Yes, it does look insincere.

423
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,018
Hui-yeon, you have to staple it

424
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,519
like this.

425
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,229
At an angle.

426
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,273
Stapler?

427
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,233
Exactly my point.

428
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:38,319
Su-min, you know your stuff.

429
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,697
Go print and staple them again.

430
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,534
All of this?

431
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:49,371
It's such a waste of paper.

432
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:52,625
Several trees were
wasted because of you.

433
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,793
I want you to understand that!

434
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,045
Sir.

435
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,756
I'm sure Ms. Yang understood.

436
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,219
Ji-won, get the
manager some coffee.

437
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,139
Sir.

438
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,142
Will you take a
look at my proposal?

439
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:13,020
I need to become a
full-time employee.

440
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,523
Shall we go and get some air?

441
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,358
Shall we?

442
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,576
I'm so sorry, Ms. Yang.

443
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,161
I didn't know.

444
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:30,996
Don't worry about it.

445
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,498
It's okay.

446
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,673
I can't leave it like this.

447
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,761
Ms. Yang.

448
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,680
Do you want to get some coffee?

449
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,684
Mr. Kim asked me
to do something.

450
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,727
Just for a second.

451
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,149
You're being kind of weird.

452
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,859
Next time.

453
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:04,238
Then take a look at
this for me at least.

454
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,908
Single household?

455
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,079
Isn't this the proposal
Mr. Kim rejected?

456
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,832
What's the point of
me looking at this?

457
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,585
Read it for me.

458
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:20,546
If you still don't have
time, it can't be helped.

459
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,548
Bye.

460
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,555
You scared me!

461
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,766
Where are you running from?

462
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,019
Well...

463
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:39,481
The meeting's over. Let's slack
off after I use the restroom.

464
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,775
Wait.

465
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:46,155
Min-hwan said he
needed to talk to me.

466
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,489
Let's chat later.

467
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,872
MEAL KIT PROPOSAL
FOR SINGLE HOUSEHOLDS

468
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,855
PAIN RELIEVER

469
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,674
Hui-yeon, something came up.

470
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,801
I have to go back to the office.

471
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,305
You want me to eat
all of this on my own?

472
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,148
I can't keep receiving
like this from you!

473
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,028
Could you hang out with me
this Sunday so I can pay back?

474
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:09,112
I'll buy!

475
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,365
Sunday?

476
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,867
In return, let's hang
out this weekend.

477
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,329
I found a yummy BBQ restaurant.
It's called Goseuljung.

478
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,416
I don't think I can do Sunday.

479
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,418
Do you have plans?

480
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,754
I do have plans,

481
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,881
but I don't think
I'm going to go.

482
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,466
You don't have to go?

483
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,510
What kind of plan is it?

484
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,305
A school reunion.

485
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,349
Then you have to go.

486
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,018
You should go to
see your first love,

487
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:41,270
and be disappointed

488
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,480
so you can move
on with your life.

489
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,025
No one knows where
my first love lives

490
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,694
or where he is.

491
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,114
I wasn't very popular in school.

492
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:57,536
Is there any reason for me to
go and dig up my shameful past?

493
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,580
Isn't that more
the reason to go?

494
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,336
If you don't go, it'll
remain a shameful past.

495
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,965
But if you go and fix it,
it'll become your history!

496
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,572
Mr. Yu!

497
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,324
Yes?

498
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,539
You asked me if I
was free on Sunday.

499
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,917
If it's urgent,
I'll come to work.

500
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,835
Didn't you have plans?

501
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,505
I do.

502
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,175
But it's not important.
Work comes first.

503
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,551
I think that's right.

504
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,346
You come first, Ms. Kang.

505
00:35:01,809 --> 00:35:03,018
Well...

506
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,232
To be honest, I was debating
whether or not I wanted to go.

507
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,275
Go.

508
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,071
Your answer will differ
depending on the situation,

509
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,697
but just try it this time.

510
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,449
You can go.

511
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,163
Just remember that you owe me.

512
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,791
What?

513
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,435
BASIC NUTRITION FOR MEAL KIT

514
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,941
Read it for me.

515
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,861
If you really don't have
time, that's okay too.

516
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,612
This is good.

517
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
Ms. Yang?

518
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,328
Did you read it?

519
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,789
Yes.

520
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,708
I read over it.

521
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,917
It's good.

522
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,090
Do you want to do it together?

523
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,181
That's not how things
work in the company.

524
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,727
Mr. Kim has a different
perspective than us...

525
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,604
He didn't even read it.

526
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,523
- What?
- I saw him.

527
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,362
He pretended to flip through it.

528
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,034
He pretended to read it.

529
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:43,952
This isn't the first.

530
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,288
When it comes to your work,

531
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,332
he shoots everything down.

532
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,588
We already know this.

533
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,515
Look at the manager.
Unbelievable.

534
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:07,893
He thinks that's power.

535
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,896
No way.

536
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,109
You lose objectivity if you've
been gaslit for too long.

537
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,820
Aside from everything else,

538
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,781
aside from his perspective,

539
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,575
what do you think?

540
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,871
Do you think my proposal
is ridiculous? Really?

541
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,586
Then I'll talk it
over with Mr. Kim.

542
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:39,466
Manager Kim Gyeong-uk...

543
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,697
She's getting on
my nerves lately.

544
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:06,952
You scared me!

545
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,495
Mr. Kim!

546
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,539
Did you enjoy your lunch?

547
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,749
If it isn't our pretty Su-min.

548
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,002
I had something
good for my stamina.

549
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:17,796
What about you?

550
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,049
I had the stir-fried
pork in the cafeteria.

551
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,759
That sounds good.

552
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,431
By the way,

553
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:32,102
I have a secret to
tell you, Mr. Kim.

554
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,229
A secret?

555
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,066
I must get a full-time
position, you know.

556
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,320
I have this idea, and I can't
seem to organize my thoughts.

557
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,866
I can help you with that.

558
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,118
Really?

559
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,536
Thank you so much.

560
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,246
It's nothing.

561
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,458
There are so many hags and
ugly women at this company.

562
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,085
That's just discouraging
for our team.

563
00:38:57,169 --> 00:39:00,005
We urgently need a
full-time employee like you.

564
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,091
Stop it.

565
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,968
You're so funny.

566
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,807
You know he only does
what he wants at work.

567
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,769
That's why he opposes
everything you say.

568
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,069
Ever since he hit on you
and you turned him down.

569
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,324
What are you saying?
That's so immature.

570
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:31,411
Kim Gyeong-uk has been immature
for the past seven years.

571
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,415
I know he was
promoted to a manager

572
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,502
after he turned in your proposal

573
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,836
with his name on it.

574
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,296
Just like Jeong Su-min

575
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,508
became a full-time
employee with my proposal.

576
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,301
He was my superior.

577
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,723
It's normal that the boss takes
credit for the entire team's work...

578
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,683
But you've never done that.

579
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,564
I'm confident in this proposal.

580
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:03,151
You know this is
a good proposal.

581
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,781
But Mr. Kim...

582
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,785
My proposal was
rejected on Monday.

583
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,829
I'll turn it in again as is.

584
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:15,122
What?

585
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,208
Once you're sure he rejected
it without reading it,

586
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:19,835
then...

587
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,254
will you join me?

588
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,986
I'm 100% sure he didn't read it.

589
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,243
No, maybe 99%?

590
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm sure Kim Gyeong-uk
didn't read it.

591
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:01,334
However, if he remembers any
of the charts or images...

592
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,711
DATING BIBLE

593
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,630
Don't be scared. I'm right.

594
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,468
I know that he's lazy
and doesn't work.

595
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,817
Mr. Kim, will you
look over this?

596
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,152
It's a new proposal.

597

00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,525
Are you messing with me?

603
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,072
The proposal you
gave me last time...

604
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,617
I don't believe this.

605
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,037
The proposal you
gave me last time...

606
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,206
was much better than this!

607
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,090
Come on.

608
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,134
I've seen bad workers,
but you're just terrible.

609
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,095
How could you suck this bad?

610
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:38,807
It's so obvious you copied
and pasted them together!

611
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:43,311
Quit if you don't want to work
instead of torturing me like this!

612
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,695
Mr. Kim, I'm so sorry.

613
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,613
It's the same proposal.

614
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,657
I'll reprint it. Just a moment.

615
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,000
Here it is. The green one.

616
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,502
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kim.

617
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,341
He didn't recognize that
it was the same one?

618
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,302
He really doesn't work, does he?

619
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,387
He never fails to disappoint.

620
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:46,291
I can't believe that
he really didn't know.

621
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,710
I mean, even the
title was the same.

622
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,420
I told you he didn't work.

623
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,089
We're on the same team now.

624
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,383
The meal kits are
going to be huge.

625
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,636
Quick, easy, and delicious
meals for consumers.

626
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,432
Okay.

627
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:06,186
Now I get why things
never went my way.

628
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,771
I can't believe it.

629
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,565
How did I trust and work
for someone like him?

630
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:13,902
Why didn't you invite me?

631
00:44:17,364 --> 00:44:18,615
Cheers.

632
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,954
I can't believe Mr. Kim.
How did he not know?

633
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,010
"Meal kits for
single households."

634
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,059
PROPOSAL PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND

BASIC NUTRITION FOR MEAL KIT

636
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,486
Cheers.

637
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,573
Why did you ask me out
on a date after work?

638
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:07,372
It's because of the secret I
told you about at work today.

639
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,458
The word, "secret"

640
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,960
gets me so excited.

641
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,550
Is pork belly okay?

642
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,678
Oh, right.

643
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,763
Didn't you eat pork for lunch?

644
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,015
Then it's two pork
meals in a row.

645
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,600
Does that suck for you?

646
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:29,519
No.

647
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,896
Korean pork is better
than Korean beef.

648
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,398
You have good taste.

649
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,482
IMPORTED PORK

650
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:36,734
Su-min, you're such
a decent woman.

651
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,154
Stop it.

652
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,739
Ji-won is a really decent woman.

653
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:46,911
You always bring her up.

654
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,998
Do you like her that much?
I can't understand women.

655
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,291
Someone like Ji-won

656
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,086
is different from us. She
went to Hanguk University.

657
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:56,671
She's smart.

658
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,006
Also,

659
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,257
she's ambitious.

660
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,135
Hanguk University? So what?

661
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,638
Kids from there only know how
to study. They're worthless.

662
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,683
Her proposal was ridiculous.
Not realistic at all.

663
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,644
But I bet she doesn't
think that way.

664
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:14,814
She'll say you won't appreciate
it and has bad taste.

665
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,441
That's what she'll think.

666
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,776
I have bad taste?

667
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:26,284
You must be a bit insecure
about your academic background.

668
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:28,119
Don't be like that.

669
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,245
University?

670
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:30,872
It's all pointless.

671
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,415
I mean,

672
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,044
I'm just saying her
idea could be good.

673
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,047
Implementing it is different.

674
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,841
That Kang Ji-won.

675
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,885
She was always so stiff.

676
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,387
She's the type to
think that way, is she?

677
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:52,185
Still, the meal kit proposal
she printed wrong by accident...

678
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,730
It's a mess, but
the idea was good.

679
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,524
You should take it.

680
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,692
We could develop it together.

681
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,655
I think it'll be a hit!

682
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,573
With you?

683
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,536
- Together?
- Yes.

684
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,498
Jiwon will probably
sidetrack and ruin it.

685
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,918
If we develop it with your
skills and experience,

686
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:22,382
I feel like this could be my
ticket to a full-time offer.

687
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:30,098
I must feel so
comfortable around you.

688
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:33,434
I talk to you as if we're
more than just coworkers.

689
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,522
Did she just say

690
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,024
what I think she said?

691
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,410
Of course. Sure. Yeah.

692
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,162
I mean, we are outside of work.

693
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,498
Here.

694
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,208
Go ahead, Su-min.

695
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,794
Talk to me more
about this proposal.

696
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,588
Sure.

697
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,340
Let's drink first.

698
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:06,509
Cheers.

699
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,600
Here comes the meat!

700
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,687
Nice shot!

701
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,609
Why is she Ji-won's friend?

702
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,819
I can't even try anything.

703
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,863
Does it matter?

704
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,866
It sounds like she's into
you too. Just go for it.

705
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,286
What? This is not some
kind of a second-hand sale.

706
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,413
Don't be stupid.

707
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,081
Was that a strike?

708
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,291
That was amazing.

709
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:40,668
Nice shot!

710
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,253
Nice shot!

711
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,054
Sang-jong.

712
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,555
Do you know any girls?

713
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:53,848
I'm going crazy.

714
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,516
Jeez.

715
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,935
You're too energetic for Friday.

716
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,395
Where's your girl?

717
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,856
Why would you bring
me down like that?

718
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,983
She's just marriage material!

719
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:06,569
What's that?

720
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,821
Listen.

721
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:13,159
She's nice, frugal, and she
takes care of my parents.

722
00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:16,496
And she works hard for
money, but doesn't spend it.

723
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,664
- How's that?
- Wow.

724
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,124
That's a perfect wife.

725
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,669
She's perfectly boring too!

726
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:26,089
She reads the company
outlook report.

727
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,924
Nobody reads that.

728
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,887
I bet she's at work looking
over documents right now.

729
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,348
Like this.

730
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,318
Getting a second chance in
life means I can do anything.

731
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,321
I managed to get back at Su-min

732
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,656
and also Kim Gyeong-uk.

733
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,534
I can do anything.

734
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,735
It's a matching item.
Wear it on Sunday.

735
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,653
Your eternal love, Su-min!

736
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,531
Did you see her earrings?

737
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,254
You've been so distant
lately. I'm upset.

738
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,506
I'm not saying it
because I'm drunk.

739
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,133
I'm sleeping over tonight.

740
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:55,803
Let's spend the weekend together
before going to Goseuljung.

741
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,308
GOSEULJUNG

742
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,768
Goseuljung.

743
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,644
I'm sure of it.

744
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,735
GOSEULJUNG

745
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,746
BUSAN TAEHA HIGH
SCHOOL'S 37TH REUNION

746
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,963
She really came.

747
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,048
Ji-won!

748
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,884
Ji-won, you came! Hey!

749
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,093
Let's go inside.

750
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,178
What is this?

751
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,181
Are we not eating alone?

752
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,142
I didn't think you'd come
if I told you about it.

753
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:46,771
We're over 30 now.
Forget about the past.

754
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,397
Our friends are all nice.

755
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,107
- Let's go.
- Su-min, I...

756
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,234
No.

757
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,161
I'm going to leave.
Will you bring my bag?

758
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,539
Kang Ji-won is incredible.

759
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,999
Why did she come? She
has no friends here.

760
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,459
She must be here to eat.

761
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:11,087
Did you see her?
She looks so poor.

762
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,632
Why are you talking like
you're from Seoul? It's weird.

763
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:18,469
Still, how is she still
hanging out with Su-min?

764
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,096
Isn't it obvious?

765
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,432
Su-min, that softie is
just too nice to her.

766
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,103
She couldn't eat at a place
like this without her.

767
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,813
Drink some milk!

768
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,532
Stop it!

769
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:50,585
Su-min is just too nice.

770
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,378
We should take care of her.

771
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,005
Did you see her earrings?

772
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:55,631
She copied Su-min's style.

773
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,342
I could tell it was
fake from a mile away.

774
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,097
Ever since high
school, Ji-won...

775
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,432
Ye-ji, wait.

776
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,684
What?

777
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,061
Ji-won wasn't at
her seat earlier.

778
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,928
Were you here all this time?

779
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,723
Why did you pretend
like you weren't?

780
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,977
You sly little thing.

781
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,319
There's no way I'm going there.

782
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,239
No, don't come. I'm not...

783
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,910
I'm coming over tonight.

784
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,621
I had a drink, and
I miss my love.

785
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,206
I'll be there in an hour.

786
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,587
Do they think my place
is a motel or something?

787
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:18,756
Those two...

788
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,342
Wait.

789
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:28,140
Actually,

790
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,643
it's going to happen
anyway. So why wait?

791
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,563
That passionate love of yours...

792
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:38,442
I'll help make it come true.

793
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,136
You can use this gate.

794
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,472
Thank you.

795
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,517
Are you just leaving?

796
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,687
Yes. Are you just
getting back to work?

797
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,857
I have some things to do.

798
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,319
Goodbye. I should get going now.

799
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:24,447
Wait.

800
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,751
This?

801
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,546
I got it as a gift.

802
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,301
That's...

803
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,722
a replica brand.

804
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:53,559
People who know can tell.

805
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:03,736
That's...

806
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,530
a replica brand.

807
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,286
People who know can tell.

808
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,538
Me?

809
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:16,082
What do you mean?

810
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,003
You shouldn't wear those.

811
00:56:21,504 --> 00:56:23,005
You shouldn't wear those.

812
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,257
I remember.

813
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:29,595
He said this to me before,
and I thought he was rude.

814
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:34,391
That's because I didn't know what
would happen to me at the reunion.

815
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,771
It was a gift from a friend, so
I thought his comment was rude.

816
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,482
I'm sorry.

817
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:42,983
No.

818
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:44,944
Thank you.

819
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,866
Shall I take you home?

820
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,660
What?

821
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,495
It's just so late.

822
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,498
No, it's fine.

823
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,542
The buses are still running.

824
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,669
I want to take you home.

825
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,635
I'll decline.

826
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,140
I have plans with my boyfriend.

827
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,185
Bye.

828
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,537
Thank you. Keep the change.

829
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:40,916
What is it?

830
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,713
I was working late.
I'm heading home now.

831
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,549
She'll drop work
and run home for me?

832
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,511
Well, she's human too.
She must be hungry for it.

833
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:55,556
I have beer in the fridge.
Have some while waiting.

834
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,892
She's so excited!

835
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,478
Kang Ji-won. You're dead today.

836
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,195
This will get you wasted, right?

837
00:58:14,617 --> 00:58:16,368
I love you, my other half.

838
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:17,912
Be nicer to me.

839
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,914
I love you! I said, I love you!

840
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:33,135
"Hurry over"?

841
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,805
She didn't use any
emojis. So cold.

842
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:38,933
She's being so mean.

843
00:58:40,226 --> 00:58:41,769
I'm not going.

844
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,853
I'm not going!

845
00:58:56,242 --> 00:59:01,789
You make my heart
flutter and sink

846
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:09,088
Ji-won, you're so dead.

847
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,382
Why did he get here so fast?

848
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,853
I'm not going. I'm
mad. I'm going home!

849
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:26,272
I'm a little upset.

850
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:28,023
What? Why won't she come?

851
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:36,407
Hey, babe.

852
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:43,956
You got here fast!

853
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:46,083
I thought it'd take you longer.

854
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,919
I couldn't wait to spend
the night with you,

855
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:51,630
so I took a taxi.

856
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,550
You didn't have to.

857
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,512
It's been...

858
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,141
so long

859
01:00:03,309 --> 01:00:04,310
for us.

860
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,853
Hasn't it?

861
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:08,939
Yeah, it really has.

862
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,942
So I was thinking we
should talk first...

863
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:15,237
Let's talk

864
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,321
with our bodies.

865
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,286
Let's put on the clothes...

866
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:26,915
We don't

867
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:28,792
need

868
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,127
any clothes

869
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,714
right now!

870
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:43,974
All right.

871
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,310
Don't move.

872
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,627
It looks so great on you!

873
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,630
Turning a shameful
past into history,

874
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,841
can't be done overnight
for someone like me.

875
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,511
Actually, I've been bullied.

876
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,847
She forgets what a loser she is.

877
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,518
I'm so glad I met you, Mr. Park.

878
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,853
I'm here. I'm behind you.

879
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,981
I had a crush on you!

880
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:34,233
There's someone I like.

881
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:37,528
Who is this woman
he's fallen for?

882
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,113
Look into it.

883
